# Fictional-space-agency-simulation
This program aims to implement a fictional space agency simulation. You will simulate a space agency that operates space missions. Each mission has an operating cost. Agency covers these costs by selling tickets to the passengers. Every mission has a probability to fail at launch, however, these failures are non fatal incidents. Agency only reschedules failed missions to a further date. However, agency has to pay operation cost of the mission.
